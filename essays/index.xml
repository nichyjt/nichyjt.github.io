Personally, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite modules of the semester despite the difficulty. You can expect to build interesting things and learn a whole range of computing topics.
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 2 iteration.
^ To reiterate, you&amp;rsquo;ll be building cool stuff :)
Similar to EPP1, expect a flipped classroom format where content learning is done asynchronusly and the hands-on learning done via labs and tutorials.</description></item><item><title>CG1111A - Mod Review</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</guid><description>Engineering Principles and Practice 1 (EPP1) CG1111A, aka EPP1 is the very first CEG module NUS Computer Engineering students will be taking.
This is the highlight module for the semester (apart from CS1010), so look forward to it!
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 1 iteration.
CG1111A is conducted in a flipped classroom format where content learning is done asynchronusly and the hands-on learning done via labs and tutorials.</description></item><item><title>Making Linux Home</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</guid><description>Linux üêß - A Tasty Introduction Are you tired of having useless, suspicious üëÄ bloatware being installed on your computer?
Are you looking for a more secure and stable machine out-of-the-box?
Are you a developer that wants to be in better control of your machine?
Perhaps Linux is for you.
What&amp;rsquo;s Linux? Linux refers to the family of Operating Systems (OS) that use the open-source Linux kernel. It may seem like a niche OS, but Linux plays a much larger role in your daily life than you might expect.</description></item></channel></rss>
