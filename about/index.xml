Testimonial about my time at TOFFS kindly done by Co-Founder Jason Kong.
Created a backend service to provide 24/7 real-time response to protect our customers&amp;rsquo; domains Automated collection &amp;amp; management of large amounts of data (2.5+ TB) covering upwards of 20k domains Developed pipelines to manage and schedule training for hundreds of ML models, each tailored to a customer&amp;rsquo;s domain behaviour Improved scalability &amp;amp; efficiency of the ML training with code optimisations and use of distributed computing APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
