Developed an AI-powered ‚Äúpower benchmarker‚Äù microsite to benchmark chip power usage from oscilloscope data Trained CNN models with up to 95% accuracy to classify BLE events from oscilloscope data using Keras Streamlined collection of live, event driven data from ESP32 chips using concurrent programming Automated region-of-interest feature extraction from time-series oscilloscope data using sklearn Created an interactive microsite to visualise typical BLE power consumption characteristics on ESP32 chips</description></item><item><title>FindNUS :telescope:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/about/projects/findnus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/about/projects/findnus/</guid><description>Executive Summary:
Awarded the highest level of achivement, given to the top 7% of teams (top 29 of 414 teams) for NUS School of Computing&amp;rsquo;s 2022 iteration of Orbital.
FindNUS is a lost and found web app built during Summer 2022 Orbital. As the backend developer, I built a RESTful API backend using a microservices architecture. Apart from regular CRUD, we also used some NLP and fuzzy searching to help lost people find their lost stuff.</description></item><item><title>ResistorPrediction :robot:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/about/projects/resistorprediction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/about/projects/resistorprediction/</guid><description>Executive Summary:
An experimental attempt to predict resistor values based on pictures of resistors. Powered by machine learning and OpenCV. Achieved up to 60% accuracy in predictions (not exactly production ready).
