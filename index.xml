The rabbit hole down containerization is deep. I skim the surface here very quickly. This should not be seen as incredibly technically complete.
Container networks in a nutshell Initialization:
When you install Docker, the docker daemon creates a network interface, (e.g. default is docker0). This network interface is a bridge.
This bridge typically has the &amp;lsquo;gateway&amp;rsquo; ip address &amp;ldquo;X.X.X.1&amp;rdquo;, and by default has a subnet of /16, meaning it can support 2^16 hosts.</description></item><item><title>Docker is not a Virtual Machine</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/docker_and_vms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/docker_and_vms/</guid><description>Docker is not a VM. Neither is it a lightweight VM. But what&amp;rsquo;s the difference? My dockerfile needs an image of an OS (e.g. Ubuntu) to run, and virtual machines (such as VirtualBox) requires an image of an OS to also run, and both produce similar runtime environments for me to run the code in. Don&amp;rsquo;t they do the same thing?
The difference is what resources they virtualize.
Hypervisors &amp;amp; Virtual Machines in 30s Hypervisors (Virtual Machine Managers) emulate hardware resources.</description></item><item><title>Yet another spinlock implementation</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/spinlock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/spinlock/</guid><description>Another Spinlock Question Implementation Explanation Limitations &amp;amp; Discussion Another Spinlock Question This question is adapted from my year&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Operating Systems finals.

Perhaps they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually free.

But a small misconception can happen due a misunderstanding of borrowing and scoping rules for the language. Let me illustrate.
For those unfamiliar, a big feature of Rust is its borrowing and ownership rules. The rules are quite elegant, and are enforced at compile-time with the compiler&amp;rsquo;s borrow checker to ensure memory safety. I will summarise the rules here briefly:
Rule 1, Ownership:
One and only one owner can exist for any data that is allocated.</description></item><item><title>BONUS: Borrowing Puzzles in Rust</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cs3211/bonus_nll/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cs3211/bonus_nll/</guid><description>In class, we discussed about Rust&amp;rsquo;s shared-xor-mutable model.
