You need to get used to writing. Lab reports, and by extension, academic writing, are the bread and butter of the academic world, even for an undergraduate.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Computer Engineering</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cg1111a/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cg1111a/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome! Hello and welcome to CG1111A! üôå
Congratulations on getting into Computer Engineering! üéâ
It was NOT easy getting here. Our IGP is pretty darn high.
Your academic career will see you touch MANY aspects of the computing world. You will explore a fair bit of the Computing world, from the lower levels e.g. Logic gates, transistors&amp;hellip; of abstraction to the higher levels e.g. Algorithms, machine learning .
Your first year here will be as fulfilling as it is challenging.</description></item><item><title>Finding Big O from non-standard recurrence relations without master method</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2023/recurrence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2023/recurrence/</guid><description>A friend taking their data structures and algorithms (DSA) class asked me a question about recurrence relations. Consider this:
$ \text{Find } O(T(n)), \text{where} ~ T(n) = 3T(\frac{2}{3}n) $
This was derived from pseudocode where 3 recursive calls are made per function call, each splitting the subproblem into (2/3) N.
Nevermind the practicality, its a DSA course after all.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit any of the common recurrence relations, so the convo went something like this:</description></item><item><title>Recovering Linux from initramfs</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/initramfs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/initramfs/</guid><description>You turned on your Linux machine and are greeted by a very scary looking terminal. You&amp;rsquo;ve booted into busybox and are in initramfs. How do I fix this?
initramfs, Image src: askubuntu question Very rarely, memory can get corrupted on your Linux machine. When that happens, you boot into the terminal above. The fix is a simple 1 line command using the fsck built-in tool.
Before using fsck, you need to identify which hard disk stores your working data.</description></item><item><title>How to choose which OS to boot into with systemd-boot</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/popos_choose_os/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/popos_choose_os/</guid><description>You are a POP!_OS user or use systemd-boot, and want this screen to pop up when you boot.

POP_OS was not configured to have the boot menu come up so there is a bit of settings config required.
Option 1: Hold spacebar When you boot, hold spacebar and the menu should show up.

FindNUS is a lost and found web application that my pal Jin Xuan and I built over summer 2022.
FindNUS was awarded the highest level of achivement, given to only the top 7% of teams (top 29 of 414 teams) for NUS School of Computing&amp;rsquo;s 2022 iteration of Orbital, an independent software development module.
We built FindNUS because we felt that the current lost and found website in NUS sucks and we could do better.</description></item><item><title>CG2111A - Mod Review</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg2111a/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg2111a/</guid><description>Engineering Principles and Practice 2 (EPP2) CG2111A, aka EPP2 is the highlight module for Computer Engineering freshies.
Personally, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite modules of the semester despite the difficulty. You can expect to build interesting things and learn a whole range of computing topics.
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 2 iteration.
Mapping the maze using Alex&amp;#39;s LiDAR ^ To reiterate, you&amp;rsquo;ll be building cool stuff :)</description></item><item><title>CG1111A - Mod Review</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</guid><description>Engineering Principles and Practice 1 (EPP1) CG1111A, aka EPP1 is the very first CEG module NUS Computer Engineering students will be taking.
This is the highlight module for the semester (apart from CS1010), so look forward to it!
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 1 iteration.
CG1111A is conducted in a flipped classroom format where content learning is done asynchronusly and the hands-on learning done via labs and tutorials.</description></item><item><title>SnipNScan :camera:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/snipnscan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/snipnscan/</guid><description>Image Hell A picture is worth a thousand words - A common adage
Images are a rich source of information. But what worth is that thousand words if I can&amp;rsquo;t extract the actual text inside the images? Let me explain my frustration about images.
Webinar Link Hell Imagine yourself in some online conference. Stare in wonder as the presenter asks you to access some (long-ass) link on their screen share. Extra points if the presenter does not drop the link into chat - good luck typing it into your browser before they move on!</description></item><item><title>Cnake :snake:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/cnake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/cnake/</guid><description>I thought it would be fun to make a one-shot snake game project to familiarise myself with the ncurses library and play around with some data structures, which led to this ripoff snake game you can find on my GitHub.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can take a look and perhaps give it a go!
The following sections of this post are just some code discussions for the nerds.
Building Cnake I won&amp;rsquo;t talk too much about the ncurses library and will be writing more about the things I found interesting while building this project, mainly, these questions I had to answer while making the game.</description></item><item><title>Making Linux Home</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</guid><description>Linux üêß - A Tasty Introduction Are you tired of having useless, suspicious üëÄ bloatware being installed on your computer?

It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to solve Sudokus, but another to create one.
Out of curiosity, I decided to try and make a fully filled Sudoku Grid by hand.</description></item><item><title>Hey There! :wave:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/homepage/intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 09:49:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/homepage/intro/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m your host, Nicholas.
