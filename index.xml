Images are a rich source of information. But what worth is that thousand words if I can&amp;rsquo;t extract the actual text inside the images? Let me explain my frustration about images.
Webinar Link Hell Imagine yourself in some online conference. Stare in wonder as the presenter asks you to access some (long-ass) link on their screen share.</description></item><item><title>Cnake :snake:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/cnake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/cnake/</guid><description>I thought it would be fun to make a one-shot snake game project to familiarise myself with the ncurses library and play around with some data structures, which led to this ripoff snake game you can find on my GitHub.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can take a look and perhaps give it a go!
The following sections of this post are just some code discussions for the nerds.
Building Cnake I won&amp;rsquo;t talk too much about the ncurses library and will be writing more about the things I found interesting while building this project, mainly, these questions I had to answer while making the game.</description></item><item><title>Making Linux Home</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</guid><description>Linux üêß - A Tasty Introduction Are you tired of having useless, suspicious üëÄ bloatware being installed on your computer?

And man, it&amp;rsquo;s fun solving them - it&amp;rsquo;s cathartic seeing the numbers fall nicely into place.
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to solve Sudokus, but another to create one.
Out of curiosity, I decided to try and make a fully filled Sudoku Grid by hand.</description></item><item><title>Hey There! :wave:</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/homepage/intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 09:49:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/homepage/intro/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m your host, Nicholas.

Testimonial about my time at TOFFS kindly done by Co-Founder Jason Kong.
Created a backend service to provide 24/7 real-time response to protect our customers&amp;rsquo; domains Automated collection &amp;amp; management of large amounts of data (2.5+ TB) covering upwards of 20k domains Developed pipelines to manage and schedule training for hundreds of ML models, each tailored to a customer&amp;rsquo;s domain behaviour Improved scalability &amp;amp; efficiency of the ML training with code optimisations and use of distributed computing APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
