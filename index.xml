If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can take a look and perhaps give it a go!
The following sections of this post are just some code discussions for the nerds.
Building Cnake I won&amp;rsquo;t talk too much about the ncurses library and will be writing more about the things I found interesting while building this project, mainly, these questions I had to answer while making the game.</description></item><item><title>Making Linux Home</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2021/linux/</guid><description>Linux üêß - A Tasty Introduction Are you tired of having useless, suspicious üëÄ bloatware being installed on your computer?

And man, it&amp;rsquo;s fun solving them - it&amp;rsquo;s cathartic seeing the numbers fall nicely into place.
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to solve Sudokus, but another to create one.
