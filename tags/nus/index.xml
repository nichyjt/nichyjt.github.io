FindNUS is a lost and found web application that my pal Jin Xuan and I built over summer 2022.
FindNUS was awarded the highest level of achivement, given to only the top 7% of teams (top 29 of 414 teams) for NUS School of Computing&amp;rsquo;s 2022 iteration of Orbital, an independent software development module.
We built FindNUS because we felt that the current lost and found website in NUS sucks and we could do better.</description></item><item><title>CG2111A - Mod Review</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg2111a/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg2111a/</guid><description>Engineering Principles and Practice 2 (EPP2) CG2111A, aka EPP2 is the highlight module for Computer Engineering freshies.
Personally, it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite modules of the semester despite the difficulty. You can expect to build interesting things and learn a whole range of computing topics.
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 2 iteration.
^ To reiterate, you&amp;rsquo;ll be building cool stuff :)
Similar to EPP1, expect a flipped classroom format where content learning is done asynchronusly and the hands-on learning done via labs and tutorials.</description></item><item><title>CG1111A - Mod Review</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2022/cg1111a/</guid><description>Engineering Principles and Practice 1 (EPP1) CG1111A, aka EPP1 is the very first CEG module NUS Computer Engineering students will be taking.
This is the highlight module for the semester (apart from CS1010), so look forward to it!
I will be sharing my experience based on the AY 21/22 Semester 1 iteration.
CG1111A is conducted in a flipped classroom format where content learning is done asynchronusly and the hands-on learning done via labs and tutorials.</description></item></channel></rss>
