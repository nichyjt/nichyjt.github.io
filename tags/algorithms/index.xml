Consider this:
$ \text{Find } O(T(n)), \text{where} \\ ~ \\ T(n) = 3T(\frac{2}{3}n) $
This was derived from pseudocode where 3 recursive calls are made per function call, each splitting the subproblem into (2/3) N.
Nevermind the practicality, its a DSA course after all.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit any of the common recurrence relations, so the convo went something like this:</description></item><item><title>Sudoku.py</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/sudoku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 21:08:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/projects/sudoku/</guid><description>Sudoku Squares are elegant, and frankly, magical.1 With pockets of time being freed up with work from home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, I picked up Sudoku to fill in the gaps. And man, it&amp;rsquo;s fun solving them - it&amp;rsquo;s cathartic seeing the numbers fall nicely into place.
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to solve Sudokus, but another to create one.
Out of curiosity, I decided to try and make a fully filled Sudoku Grid by hand.</description></item></channel></rss>
