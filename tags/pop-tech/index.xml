Art piece at Parkview hotel The art seems simple. Four humans dressed in prison clothes. They face a cage and are postured towards it. The prisoners are uncaged, free, liberated; yet it seems like they long for the cage. Huh? Why would the prisoners want to be caged?
Perhaps they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually free. If they were free, then they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be facing the cage or walking towards it.</description></item></channel></rss>
