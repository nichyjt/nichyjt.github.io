The rabbit hole down containerization is deep. I skim the surface here very quickly. This should not be seen as incredibly technically complete.
Container networks in a nutshell Initialization:
When you install Docker, the docker daemon creates a network interface, (e.g. default is docker0). This network interface is a bridge.
This bridge typically has the &amp;lsquo;gateway&amp;rsquo; ip address &amp;ldquo;X.X.X.1&amp;rdquo;, and by default has a subnet of /16, meaning it can support 2^16 hosts.</description></item><item><title>IP addresses</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/ip/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/essays/2025/ip/</guid><description>This is a personal braindump on everything I might need to know about IP addresses.
The problem IP addresses solves is uniquely identify what node on the interwebs to send data to. There are billions of devices and an order of magnitude more virtual devices, all wanting to communicate with one another. How do we uniquely identify them?
Addresses IP addresses are used as a way to identify a network interface.</description></item></channel></rss>
