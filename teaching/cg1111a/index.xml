You need to get used to writing. Lab reports, and by extension, academic writing, are the bread and butter of the academic world, even for an undergraduate.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Computer Engineering</title><link>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cg1111a/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nichyjt.github.io/teaching/cg1111a/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome! Hello and welcome to CG1111A! ðŸ™Œ
Congratulations on getting into Computer Engineering! ðŸŽ‰
It was NOT easy getting here. Our IGP is pretty darn high.
Your academic career will see you touch MANY aspects of the computing world. You will explore a fair bit of the Computing world, from the lower levels e.g. Logic gates, transistors&amp;hellip; of abstraction to the higher levels e.g. Algorithms, machine learning .
Your first year here will be as fulfilling as it is challenging.</description></item></channel></rss>
