Hello and welcome to CG1111A! ðŸ™Œ
Congratulations on getting into Computer Engineering! ðŸŽ‰
It is NOT easy getting here. You deserve a pat on the back, really! Our IGP is pretty darn high.
Buckle up, because your first year here will be as fulfilling as it is challenging. Although the road ahead may feel scary and daunting&amp;hellip; Discrete structures? Algorithms? Fourier Transforms? Forget all that. Take it one step at a time!</description></item></channel></rss>
